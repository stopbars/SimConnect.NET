		A modern, high-performance C# wrapper for Microsoft Flight Simulator's SimConnect SDK. It simplifies flight simulation development by providing async/await patterns and high-level abstractions, enabling real-time aircraft data monitoring, AI object management,           and seamless integration with the simulator through a clean, type-safe API.
